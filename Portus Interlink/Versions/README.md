# Local Server with Graphical Interface

A lightweight and user-friendly application that turns any folder on your computer into a locally accessible server. Designed to quickly share content, test websites, teach, or transfer files between devices without needing the cloud.

Features

- Clear and simple visual interface
- Lets you choose any folder on your computer
- Manual port configuration
- Automatically shows your local IP address
- Buttons to start and stop the server
- Accessible from other devices on the same network

How to use

1. Download or clone this repository

2. Open the application on your system

3. Select a folder, choose your desired port, and click “Start Server”

4. On another device connected to the same network, open a browser and access the server using:

   http://[your_local_ip]:[your_chosen_port]

   Example: http://192.168.1.50:8000

Sharing outside your network

If you want your content to be accessible online, you can manually configure port forwarding on your router or use automated network tools if your system supports them. Always make sure to secure your content when exposing it publicly.

Recommendations

- Avoid sharing private or sensitive data if the server is exposed to the internet
- Use ports above 1024 to prevent system conflicts
- Always stop the server when not in use

Best use cases

- Test and preview web projects from different devices
- Share educational material in classrooms or workshops
- Transfer files locally without needing cables or external services
- Create fast and portable hosting environments

Planned improvements

- Automatic public IP detection
- Optional automatic port forwarding
- Access logs and connection tracking
- Dark mode and visual customization
- Folder history and session memory
